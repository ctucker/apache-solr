                    Apache Solr - DataImportHandler Version 1.3-dev
                            Release Notes

Introduction
------------
DataImportHandler is a data import tool for Solr which makes importing data from Databases, XML files and
HTTP data sources quick and easy.


$Id$

================== Release 1.4-dev ==================
Upgrading from Solr 1.3
-----------------------

Evaluator API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. Users who have developed custom Evaluators will need
to change their code according to the new API for it to work. See SOLR-996 for details.

The formatDate evaluator's syntax has been changed. The new syntax is formatDate(<variable>, '<format_string>').
For example, formatDate(x.date, 'yyyy-MM-dd'). In the old syntax, the date string was written without a single-quotes.
The old syntax has been deprecated and will be removed in 1.5, until then, using the old syntax will log a warning.

New Features
----------------------
1. SOLR-768:  Set last_index_time variable in full-import command.
              (Wojtek Piaseczny, Noble Paul via shalin)

2. SOLR-811:  Allow a "deltaImportQuery" attribute in SqlEntityProcessor which is used for delta imports

================== Release 1.3.0 20080915 ==================

Status
------
This is the first release since DataImportHandler was added to the contrib solr distribution.
The following changes list changes since the code was introduced, not since
the first official release.


Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
1. SOLR-700:  Allow configurable locales through a locale attribute in fields for NumberFormatTransformer.
              (Stefan Oestreicher, shalin)

Changes in runtime behavior

Bug Fixes
1. SOLR-704:  NumberFormatTransformer can silently ignore part of the string while parsing. Now it tries to
              use the complete string for parsing. Failure to do so will result in an exception.
              (Stefan Oestreicher via shalin)

2. SOLR-729:  Context.getDataSource(String) gives current entity's DataSource instance regardless of argument.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)
