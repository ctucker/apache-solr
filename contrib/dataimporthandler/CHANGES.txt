              (Stefan Oestreicher, shalin)

Changes in runtime behavior

Bug Fixes

              use the complete string for parsing. Failure to do so will result in an exception.

2. SOLR-729:  Context.getDataSource(String) gives current entity's DataSource instance regardless of argument.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

              (Walter Ferrara, Noble Paul, shalin)
