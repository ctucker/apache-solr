Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features

Changes in runtime behavior
 1. SOLR-278:  Modify LukeRequest/Response to support SOLR-266 schema display.
    (Will Johnson via ryan)

 2. SOLR-280: Changed the SolrDocument / SolrInputDocument implementation.  
    The API to build documents has changed -- you need to pass a boost 
    (or null) with every field.  (ryan)

 3. SOLR-462: Changes to CommonsHttpSolrServer.java to add soTimeout (read 
    timeout), connection pool timeout, directive to not follow HTTP redirects, 
    configurable retries on NoHttpResponseException, compression, and not 
    creating a new HttpClient on each request.  If your existing code overrides 
    getHttpConnection(), you will now need to override createHttpClient()
